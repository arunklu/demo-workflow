            <Title level={3}> DELIVERY GURU TERMS AND CONDITIONS</Title>
            <Paragraph>
          

        <Paragraph>DELIVERY GURU Limited is a company registered in Scotland with registered company number
             SC662596, whose registered office is at Unit 1, The Maxwell Building, East Kilbride, G75 0QR.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>These are the terms and conditions upon which DELIVERY GURU.Limited provide access to our website https://www.deliveryguru.co.uk and any DELIVERY GURU mobile application through which you order food & drink ("the portal"). Please read these Terms & Conditions carefully before ordering through the Delivery Guru portal. By ordering through the portal you agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions, taken together with our Cookies and Privacy Policy. By accessing any part of our portal, you confirm that you accept these Terms & Conditions. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order food & drink through the Website.
</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>We provide a way for you to communicate your food & drink orders to delivery or takeaway restaurants on the Website. The actual contract is between you and the restaurant or takeaway that you place the Order with. We will act as an intermediary in our 
            capacity as the restaurant or takeaway’s commercial agent to allow conclusion of the sale.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>ALLERGIES: If you have a specific food allergy or intolerance, you will contact the Restaurant directly to check that the food is suitable for you, before placing your order directly with them. When a Restaurant signs up with us, they have to provide us with up-to-date menu information. We then include this on their dedicated page on the Website. Where this information includes allergy or other dietary information, we will do our best to republish this information on the website or app exactly as it appears on the restaurant's menu. If you have, or someone you are ordering for has, a concern about food allergies, intolerances or other dietary preferences, you should always contact the Restaurant directly before placing your order. Please do not use the "leave a note for the Restaurant"
             box for your food allergies or intolerances, please contact the Restaurant directly.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>	You may access some areas of the Website without making an Order or
             registering your details with us. Most of the Website is open to everyone.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave 
            the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>We may revise these Website Terms at any time. The revised terms will be subject to the
             policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>	If you place an Order through the Website, you warrant that (i) You are at least 18 years old. and (ii)
             You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts with Restaurant.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Website information: While we try to ensure that information on the Website is correct, we do not promise it is accurate or complete. We may make changes to the material on the Website, or to the functionality, Products and prices described on it, at any time without notice. 
            The material on the Website may be out of date, and we make no commitment to update that material.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>	Once you have selected the food & drink that you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order" or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so you will be entering into a contract with the Restaurant and errors cannot be corrected (subject to paragraph 4.2. below). Where you have not logged in or created an account previously, then you may have the option to continue with your Order as a guest. By electing to complete your Order as a guest, you are agreeing that DELIVERY GURU will create a temporary DELIVERY GURU guest account for you which will, unless otherwise stated in these Website Terms, be accessible only (a) from the device which you use to place the Order; and (b) for a period of up to twelve months following the date of the Order.  Your access to your temporary guest account will expire on the “Expiry Date” which shall be the earlier of (i) the date falling six months after the date on which you last accessed the temporary guest account; (ii) the date falling twelve months after the date on which the temporary guest account was created; and (iii) the date on which you logout of your temporary guest account, 
            or clear the cache on the device which you used when the temporary guest account was created.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraphs 4.4 and 5.6 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders and refunding of payment). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant 
            will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>On receipt of your Order, we will send it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation email that you may receive each confirm that you have a contract for the sale of Products with a Restaurant but does not necessarily mean that your Order will be fulfilled by the Restaurant. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. However, Restaurants have the ability to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. In doing so, Restaurants will be in breach of their agreement with you and any payment made in
             respect of the order will be returned to you in accordance with paragraph 5.6 below.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders
             will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times. </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>For the avoidance of doubt, any orders processed by DELIVERY GURU through the Website are
             processed by DELIVERY GURU in its capacity as commercial agent of the relevant Restaurant.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Prices will be as quoted on the Website. These prices include VAT but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of collection) and any administration or service charge
             imposed by the Restaurant. These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. If the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website, we will normally contact you before the relevant Order is dispatched. In such an event, neither we nor the relevant Restaurant is under any obligation to ensure that the Order is provided to you
             at the incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to, or collection by, you.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery or collection as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card corresponds with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to sixty
             (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by DELIVERY GURU, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms & Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers. Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period. The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance. You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account. Where you use the Website as a guest, any account credit which you accrue against your temporary guest account can only be redeemed for 
            an Order placed via your temporary guest account and cannot be transferred for use on another account.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>Rejected Orders: Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will "ring-fence" the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance. However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in
             relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Questions about your Order: If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other problems with your Order, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our 
            Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on your query.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Changing or cancelling your Order: If you wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorised, you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that
             the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Complaints or feedback: In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews")
             to reflect your experience. The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>	Compensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you should contact the Restaurant directly to lodge your complaint and, where appropriate, follow the Restaurant's own complaint procedures. If you are unable to contact the Restaurant, or the Restaurant refuses to deal with your complaint, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above within 48 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request compensation on your behalf. Please note, however, that the legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with. We have no control over Restaurants and the quality of the Products or service that they provide, and we are not able to provide, and have no 
            responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant.</Paragraph>
